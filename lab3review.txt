Correct output for some queries
Mostly correct SQL statements
SQL statements are somewhat readable

Recommendations: 
 To improve your readability, write queries instead of this
  select *
  from products
  where (city != 'Dallas' and city != 'Duluth') and (priceUSD >= 1.00);
 do it like this:
  SELECT *
  FROM products
  WHERE city != 'Dallas' 
    AND city != 'Duluth' 
    AND priceUSD >= 1;



1. List the ordno and dollars of all orders.

LINE 1:  select ordno, dollars select * from orders

MISSING QUERY!


In general: 

- Be careful with the way you are using parenthesis. They were not
strictly necessary for this lab. Use them only if necessary or if it helps with
the organization of the SQL statement.

- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.

- You submitted a text file, that was not runnable, I had to convert your
  file to the desired format. Please check the file I created lab3.sql
